## How to Play

Go to the [itch.io](https://theflyingfoox.itch.io/coil) page and just click Run Game! You'll have to be on desktop, and you'll almost certainly need a mouse.

Once you're in a level, you can start moving around. Pressing space will hop (or dive in a held direction), and you'll get into the MOVING state. Once moving, pressing left click will bring out your legs, which will always stick to the bottom of your screen as you look up and down or left and right. You can always use right click to bring out your arms, which will grab ledges when you look at them, and can be dragged down (by looking down) to pull yourself up. When moving and using your legs, you can also pull your legs back (by quickly looking down) while hitting the ground to kick, giving you a speed boost. Once you master diving, jumping, kicking, and grabbing, you'll be able to complete the levels!

You can press 'q' at any time to access the pause menu and exit or retry the level.
